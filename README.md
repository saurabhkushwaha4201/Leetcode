# 🏰 dsa-dungeon

Welcome to **dsa-dungeon** — the realm where I battle daily DSA monsters and level up my problem-solving skills.

This repository contains all my **LeetCode solutions**, synced automatically using the **LeetSync extension**.  
Every file here represents a quest completed: some easy goblins, some medium trolls, and the occasional hard-level dragon. 🐉

## ⚔️ What’s Inside?

- 🧩 **Daily puzzles & algorithmic challenges**
- 🔥 **Greedy goblins** (Greedy Algorithms)
- 🌀 **Recursion traps**  
- 🧙 **Dynamic Programming demons**
- 🛡️ **Graph labyrinths**
- 🧠 **Tree spirits & Binary Search beasts**
- 📦 **Hashmap hoarders**
- 🎯 **Clean, optimized code** (or at least heroic attempts 😄)

## 🎮 Why This Exists

This repo serves as my personal dungeon crawl — a fun way to stay consistent, track progress, and level up in Data Structures & Algorithms.  
Every solved problem is XP gained on the path to becoming a **DSA hero**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Solve problems on **LeetCode**
2. **LeetSync** automatically commits the solutions here
3. I gather XP and march forward to the next quest

---

## 🏆 Final Goal

To slay every algorithmic beast, conquer every dungeon, and master the art of clean, efficient, and elegant code.

### ⚔️ Enter at your own risk.  
**The dungeon hungers.**
